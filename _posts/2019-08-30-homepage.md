## Michael Seche

Seche is a network and security analyst focused on network security, web application vulnerabilities, and malware analysis. Previously he specialized in security policy and intelligence-gathering in the Middle East and North Africa, with an emphasis on sub-state levels of violence (e.g., insurgencies and terrorism).

Seche became interested in information security when he was researching the cyberwarfare capabilities of global terrorist organizations. His infosec journey began when he was studying Islamic State (IS) propaganda and the ways in which ISIS use encrypted channels to communicate and coordinate attacks. It was to better understand *how* encryption works that Seche moved full-time into learning about computer science and information security.

### Projects and Writing Samples
-[OWASP Top 10: Examples and Walkthroughs](https://github.com/mseche/mseche.github.io/tree/master/_posts/OWASP.md)       
-For posterity's sake, I wanted to include the first python script I ever wrote:

```python
import os
         
try:
   os.mkdir('CyberSecurity-Notes')
except:
   print('Folder already exists.')

for count in range(0,25):
   os.mkdir('/Users/michaelseche/Desktop/CyberSecurity-Notes/{}'.format("Week "+str(count+1)))

for root, dirs, files in os.walk('CyberSecurity-Notes'):
   for directory in dirs:
         os.chdir('/Users/michaelseche/Desktop/CyberSecurity-Notes/{}'.format(directory))
         current_directory=os.getcwd()
         for count in range(1,4):
                  os.mkdir(current_directory+"/Day "+str(count))
```
