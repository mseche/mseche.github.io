## Michael Seche

Michael Seche is a network and security analyst focused on web application vulnerabilities, network security, and malware analysis. Previously he specialized in security policy in the Middle East and North Africa with an emphasis on sub-state levels of violence (e.g., insurgencies and terrorism).

Seche transitioned into cybersecurity as a response to the growth of US adversaries expanding their cyber capabilities to influence and threaten the interests of the United States and its allies. Aside from the obvious threats posed by state actors like China, Russia, and North Korea, nonstate actors such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda have also shown an interest and capacity to grow their cyber capabilities.

While he is currently focused on developing further within the field of cybersecurity, Seche has the long-term goal of integrating his expertise on MENA security with infosec, insha'allah.
