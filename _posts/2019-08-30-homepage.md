## Michael Seche

Michael Seche is a network and security analyst focused on web application vulnerabilities, network security, and malware analysis. Previously he specialized in security policy in the Middle East and North Africa with an emphasis on sub-state levels of violence (e.g., insurgencies and terrorism).

Seche transitioned into cybersecurity as a response to the growth of US adversaries expanding their cyber capabilities to influence and threaten the interests of the United States and its allies. Aside from the obvious threats posed by state actors like China, Russia, and North Korea, nonstate actors such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda have also shown an interest and capacity to strengthen their cyber capabilities. It was during the course of his work investigating the Islamic State's cyberterrorist attacks that Seche became deeply interested in information security.

### Projects and Writing Samples
-[OWASP Top 10: Examples and Walkthroughs](https://github.com/mseche/mseche.github.io/tree/master/_posts/OWASP.md)       
-For posterity's sake, I wanted to include the first python script I ever wrote, even if it is a bit basic:  

```python
import os
         
try:
   os.mkdir('CyberSecurity-Notes')
except:
   print('Folder already exists.')

for count in range(0,25):
   os.mkdir('/Users/michaelseche/Desktop/CyberSecurity-Notes/{}'.format("Week "+str(count+1)))

for root, dirs, files in os.walk('CyberSecurity-Notes'):
   for directory in dirs:
         os.chdir('/Users/michaelseche/Desktop/CyberSecurity-Notes/{}'.format(directory))
         current_directory=os.getcwd()
         for count in range(1,4):
                  os.mkdir(current_directory+"/Day "+str(count))
```
